# Logistic-Regression-Machine-Learning
The goal of this project is to build machine learning models that can predict whether a customerâ€™s loan application (or insurance claim) will be approved. The project focuses on Logistic Regression algorithm while also applying regularization techniques and hyperparameter optimization (with GridSearchCV).
